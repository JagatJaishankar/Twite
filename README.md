## The Problem

*Developers want to build in public but get stuck staring at the “What’s happening?” box with nothing to say. They already have notes, daily logs, and scraps of ideas—but turning that into short, engaging tweets takes time, energy, and copywriting skills. The result is inconsistent posting, low visibility, and missed opportunities to grow an audience while shipping.*

## The Solution

*Twite lets developers upload or paste their daily journal and automatically turns it into tweet‑ready posts. Powered by ChatGPT and trained on high‑performing Twitter formats, it rewrites raw notes into punchy, scroll‑stopping updates that can be pasted straight into X in seconds. You keep focusing on building, while Twite handles sounding good in public.*
